        out content, and styling with HTML5 and CSS3. Web pages are styled to respond to various screen
        sizes using CSS libraries such as Bootstrap. We program the browser with JavaScript, but quickly
        move on to jQuery to deal with browser and JavaScript language fragmentation. Single page
        applications and component based development are introduced as the modern Web application
        paradigm with React.js being the current most popular solution of choice. The challenge of
        application state management is solved with Redux. We'll learn how to create RESTful Web
        services with Node.js and use MongoDB as a permanent storage solution.

    <p class="bg-red" id="focus">
        Lectures <u>will focus on developing</u> a practical understanding of Web application
        development. The assignments are used as an example of applying the concepts to solve a
        practical problem. Lectures are intended to be live, but if you must miss a class or you are
        remote, all lectures will be recorded and available on your Zoom dashboard.
    </p>

    <div>
        The assignments consist of building a complete Web application using various technologies. The
        assignments give students the opportunity to practice what is discussed in class to achieve a
        practical level of understanding of the concepts.
    </div>

    <div id="encouraged">
        Students are encouraged to form teams of up to four members to collaborate on a team project due
        at the end of the semester. The team project will allow students to collaboratively complete a
        Web application from start to finish, including design & creation/optimization, as well as a
        dynamic user-interface.
    </div>

    <div class="important-highlight">
        All lectures are intended to be in person and students are expected to regularly attend lectures
        on campus. Online/Asynchronous courses will meet over Zoom using the links below. If you have a
        health concern you are encouraged to stay home and you can join the lecture through the Zoom
        link shown below. All lectures will be recorded and available through Zoom. Lectures will be
        held at the days and time shown below and will be recorded for those that can not attend. All
        times are Eastern Standard Time (EST). CS4550 and CS5610-07 students are expected to attend at
        the date and time shown, but if you can not because of your time zone, or other reasonable
        circumstances, you can view the lecture recordings. The recordings are meant as a convenience
        and not as an alternative or to be "binge watched" at a later time. The course is hands on and
        fast paced, and the lectures will contain time sensitive tasks you are responsible for.
    </div>

    <div>
        <span style="color: yellow">Submissions will be made via Canvas</span>. Each assignment will have instructions on what to
        submit, but generally you will submit a link to a github repository and/or an online hosted
        server running a Web application. Code is expected to be professional and properly
        documented; any required data files and library dependencies must be resolvable via pom.xml
        or package.json files. All source code must be available through a public GitHub repository.
        Instructors must be able to clone your repository, build, and run your project from their
        local environments. There will be about 10 assignments in total
    </div>

    <div>
        <u>This class has very strict standards for borrowing code</u>: if you borrow anything for use in
        your assignment/project, you must have a citation, even if it's your own code from previous
        semesters and/or other courses. A good guideline is that if you take more than three lines
        of code from some source, you must include the information on where it came from. A URL or a
        notation (e.g., "MATLAB help files") is fine. If it is an entire function, note it at the
        beginning of the code segment and include any original credit information. Provide a
        qualitative description of what you used, and what you changed/contributed. If you have a
        question about what is considered a violation of this policy, ASK!
